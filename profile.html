  <p>Online information session</p>

  <h2>9. What do you see yourself doing after completing the program?</h2>
  <p>I’m not completely sure yet what I want to do after finishing this program, but I’m really interested in software engineering. I like the idea of building things that people can actually use. Over the next four years, I hope to become fluent in several programming languages and get comfortable with different technologies. I also want to grow in professional skills, like working well in a team and being able to communicate with customers, so I can understand what they need and create solutions that really help them.</p>

  <h2>10. Do you have a (part-time) job?</h2>
  <p>Yes</p>

  <h2>11. How many hours do you work a week?</h2>
  <p>10–15</p>

  <h2>12. Do you have a hobby or interest?</h2>
  <p>One of my hobbies is going to the gym. I used to go on a consistent basis, and even though I haven’t kept it up recently, I’d really like to get back into it. I enjoy it because it helps me stay active and it’s a good way to clear my mind outside of studying.</p>

  <h2>13. What are your strengths?</h2>
  <p>One of my strengths is that I don’t give up easily. When I run into challenges, I keep trying until I find a solution.</p>

  <h2>14. What are your weaknesses?</h2>
  <p>One of my weaknesses is that I can get stressed quickly when I run into a problem. I’m working on staying calmer in those situations, because I know it will help me focus better and find solutions more effectively.</p>

  <h2>15. Which opportunities do you see?</h2>
  <p>Since I chose the international class, I see a big opportunity to improve my English, especially my speaking and pronunciation. I think being more confident in English will really help me in my studies and later when working with people from different countries.</p>

  <h2>16. Which threats do you see?</h2>
  <p>One challenge I see is keeping up with all my work and completing all my ECs on time. I see this as an opportunity to improve my time management and stay organized, so I can make the most out of the program and keep progressing steadily.</p>

  <h2>17. Do you participate in top-level sports?</h2>
  <p>No</p>

  <h2>18. Are there factors that could hinder your studies?</h2>
  <p>No</p>

  <h2>19. Have you used any special arrangements before?</h2>
  <p>No</p>

  <h2>20. Which questions do you have about your programme?</h2>
  <p>I’d like to know more about the Study Abroad Minor (SAM). How does it work, and what opportunities are there for studying in another country as part of this program?</p>
